# Lab 3: Python Functions via Bash

## Overview
In this lab, we explored different Python packages and scripts to test different functions. We used Git Bash to interact with the various libraries and system-level data. We practiced using external packages like `geopy`, `astral`, `jdcal`, and Python's built-in `datetime` tools to gather system and geographic information.
