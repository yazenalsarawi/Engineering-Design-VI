# Lab 10: Blockchain

## Hashing

Hashing secures and verifies data by converting it into a unique value. The file hash_value.py demonstrates hashing on various types of inputs.

## Blockchain

snakecoin.py simulates a simple blockchain by adding new blocks with unique hashes. Each block confirms the previous one, forming a secure chain.

Running this script produces a long list of blocks being added to the chain.
